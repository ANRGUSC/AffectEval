AffectEval is a modular and customizable affcetive computing framework, aimed to facilitate the development of 
end-to-end affective computing pipelines. It is Python-based and designed in an object-oriented paradigm, with 
separate classes for each component in the affective computing pipeline (see Fig. 1).

AffectEval was designed with mental healthcare-focused affective computing applications in mind, and primarily supports
time-series data at the moment. We plan to expand our scope to include other types of signals as well, such as 
text, video, and audio.
